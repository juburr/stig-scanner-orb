# Changelog

All notable changes to the STIG Scanner Orb are documented here. Releases use
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## 1.0.0

Initial production release.

- Scan container images, image tarballs, and extracted root filesystems with
  `oscap-chroot`, without mounting the Docker socket into the scanner.
- Resolve Wolfi, Debian 12, Ubuntu 22.04, RHEL 8/9/10, and Fedora scan plans,
  including automatic target detection.
- Use RPM-capable OpenSCAP probes for RHEL-family targets with datastreams
  supplied from the Chainguard scanner image.
- Emit HTML, XCCDF XML, a human-readable summary, and the resolved scan plan as
  persistent CircleCI artifacts.
- Support optional failure gating, auditable ignore lists, profile overrides,
  air-gap image/datastream overrides, and standard `pre-steps`/`post-steps`.
- Exercise Wolfi, Debian/Ubuntu, RHEL 8/9, Fedora, and every input mode in the
  tag-gated release workflow before the production orb is published.
